### Refactor

### Description

* Horiseon is a company dedicated to helping businesses survive and thrive in a competitive market. We started this company in 2019, and since then we have helped over 20 small businesses expand their brand name and image.

### Code Style

* The coding used in our website is standard html, semantic, and css. All comments were left for all the fixes made to the website's code. Most of the fixes are just based on making standard html into semantic for an easier coding experience. Changed divs with classes to header, footer, nav, and figure tags to make it easier to work on.

### How to Use

* The website is very easy to use because it is mostly informational. The website is meant to be informative to potential clients and give as much information as possible. If the customer likes what we have to offer, they are able to email or call us to go forward with our services.
